Simple android app for indoor navigation with machine learning model on Android

GPS localization is used in almost every aspect of navigation known today. Navigation has become such a large part of everyday life due to people traveling greater distances than ever before. However, once the person has gotten to their destination from the outside they may still not know their way around the interior of a building they have arrived at. This app provides a seamless way to continue the navigation aspects of people's lives into the indoor space. As GPS does not have the accuracy we desire in buildings, therefore we use fingerprinting and dead reckoning. Fingerprinting employs a machine learning model and uses Wi-Fi signals as inputs to determine the user's location. Dead reckoning detects steps to move the cursor between fingerprinting scans.
